How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
	Bugs which are caused due to change in last version can be found easily.diff helps to find the changes.It is enought to check the lines changed instead
	of checking the entire file.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
	It helps to revert to the earlier version when needed. It helps to find the changes made in each version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	pros:
		changes are made after files are updated completely.
		consumes less bandwidth
	cons:
		Things get complex if we forget to update the changes
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Each project have multiple files and dependency so updation are made upon multiple files.
	so commiting multiple files once is a  good way.
